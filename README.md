# PsyExperiment
A psychophysics experiments as a part of [Assignment 3](https://github.com/bcs-iitk/BCS_Workshop_Apr_20/tree/master/Psychophysics/Assignment) of BCS Workshop.  

## Objective:

This experiment is to test that search asymmetries can cause visual coding of some qualitative properties as deviation from a standard value. I used a prototypical shape (circle) with shapes that deviated from it (ellipse).

## Result:

The asymmetry favours the search for the target ellipses. Fast search for the ellipse suggests that circles can be checked parallely for the presence of ellipses, but this is not the case when searching ellipses for the presence of a circle. Moreover, there is no impact of varying the orientation of ellipses on the search for
ellipses. Whereas varied orientation slowed down the search for circles.
